    <h4>Code Sample Demonstration</h4>

    <br/>

    <strong><u>Connected Path</u></strong>: <br/>
    A marketplace model in which each individual merchant must have a PayPal account.

    <br/>
    <br/>

    <ol>
        <li>To run the code sample, first enter your own Partner credentials in paypalConfig.php
            <ul>
                <li>Update PARTNER_ID with your Partner Payer ID.</li>
                <li>Update PARTNER_BN_CODE with your PayPal Partner Attribution ID.</li>
                <li>Update PARTNER_CLIENT_ID with the Partner REST App Client Id and PARTNER_CLIENT_SECRET with the corresponding Client Secret.</li>
                <li>Update PARTNER_EMAIL with your Partner Account Email.</li>

            </ul>
        </li>
        <li> Verify that you have everything set up correctly by running PhP unit tests:
            <ul>
                <li> wget https://phar.phpunit.de/phpunit-5.7.phar (To get PHPUnit 5.7)    			</li>
                <li>  mv phpunit-5.7.phar /usr/local/bin/phpunit    			</li>
                <li> chmod a+x  /usr/local/bin/phpunit
                <li>  phpunit --version (should return "PHPUnit 5.7.23 by Sebastian Bergmann and contributors.")</li>
                <li>   phpunit Tests/unit_test.php </li>

            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Click on the "Onboarding" link in the "Connected Path" section of the web page.<br/>
            This step will show you the merchant onboarding experience for the Connected Path, with most form field values pre-filled already.
            <ul>
                <li>Click the "Call Prefill API" button.(Refer to the isu_2.php file for the API calls.)</li>
                <li>Click the "Enable PayPal" link to start the merchant's onboarding experience.</li>
                <li>It will open a mini-browser to start the merchant's onboarding experience. (Refer to isu_2.php to understand the script needed for the mini-browser/in-context experience.)</li>
                <li>Enter values for the blank entries like password, last four digits of SSN etc. For personal information, please use dummy information while running the demo.</li>
                <li>Once the flow is completed, you will see a success screen in the mini-browser. It will show the email-address of the onboarded seller. <br/>Please note down this email address. You will need this in the Checkout flow of the Order API request.
                    <br/>Note: You may onboard a seller with a specific email address by changing the "email_address" parameter in the Onboarding request call.</li>
                <li>Follow the above processs to onboard one more seller.</li>
            </ul>
